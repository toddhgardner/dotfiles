AngularJS 1.0.0
--------------------

This version of AngularJS is now a merge of the following two packages:
AngularJS - http://deansofer.com/projects/view/74/AngularJs_tmbundle
AngularJS Attributes Completion - http://subhaze.github.io/angularjs-attributes

This new package provides similar functionality of the two but with added features and options.

Some of the added features are:
- Quick Panel search of directives/controllers/filters/etc...
- GoTo definition for directives
- GoToDocs for core AngularJS directives
- Directive completions for your custom defined directives
